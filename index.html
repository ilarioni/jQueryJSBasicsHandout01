    <h1>What is jQuery?</h1>
    <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
    <p>The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>

    <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>

    <h4>The jQuery library contains the following features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
        <li>CSS manipulation</li>
        <li>HTML event methods</li>
        <li>Effects and animations</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of other JavaScript libraries out there, but jQuery is probably the most popular, and also the most extendable.</p>
